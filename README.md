Discord bot, in progress. Suggestions welcome, as this is a learning experience, but please do not contribute to the repo directly.
This is my first ever C# program and Discord bot, but I have plenty experience in programming by now, so I thought it would be a good idea to attempt something like this.

Much of the code is repurposed from some open-source examples or published Discord bots, like KurumiBot.

# ==== ==== ==== ==== ====

- CODED IN C#
- Created with Discord.NET
- Not necessarily open-source just yet. (Will be entirely open-source when complete.)
      (If you want to create a fork or clone and challenge my coding skills, go ahead. See if you can make a better bot, but I won't share any of the game content with you until           it's finished.)
- Bot name is tentative and a placeholder.

# ==== ==== ==== ==== ====

A Discord bot intended to run an in-progress, Discord-based and text-based, intrigue and deception game called Clouded Shores. It is a game intended to be played like Town of Salem, Throne of Lies, or other party games like Werewolf or Mafia. The game's theme is intended to be set in different settings, depending on the roles and factions in play, but that is all for illustrative purposes, rather than gameplay mechanics.
